# 🚀 AI Chatbot: Gemini API + Local LLMs with Ollama

> A powerful AI chatbot that seamlessly blends cloud-based Gemini with local LLMs via Ollama.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**PS 8: Reimagine Peer-to-Peer Learning & Mentorship**

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project addresses the need for accessible, intelligent, and flexible peer-to-peer learning tools. By combining cloud-based AI (Gemini) with local LLMs (via Ollama), it empowers learners and mentors to interact, ask questions, and explore knowledge collaboratively — even in offline or privacy-sensitive environments. The tool enhances personalized learning experiences and supports mentorship in both connected and disconnected settings..

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:

`NA` - solo hacker

### Team Members:

* Gourav Sharma 

### Your Approach:

* I chose this problem to create a learning tool that works reliably in both connected and offline environments, making mentorship more accessible.

* Key challenges addressed included integrating cloud and local LLMs, ensuring smooth user experience when switching between engines, and maintaining usability for non-technical users.

* During development, I pivoted from a purely online chatbot to a hybrid model after realizing the benefits of offline mentorship support — especially for learners in remote or low-connectivity areas..
